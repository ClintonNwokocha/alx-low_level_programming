# 0x0E. C - Structures, typedef

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering Programme. In this project, we will delve into the concept of structures in the C programming language and how to utilize `typedef` for creating type definitions.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand what structures are and when, why, and how to use them.
- Learn how to use `typedef`.

## Requirements

- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- Code should use the Betty style for checking code and documentation.
- No global variables allowed.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- The only allowed standard library functions are `printf`, `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`.
- All header files should be include guarded.

## Files

This repository contains the following files:

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `dog.h` | Header file containing the definition of the `struct dog` and prototypes. |
| `1-init_dog.c` | Function that initializes a variable of type `struct dog`. |
| `2-print_dog.c` | Function that prints a `struct dog`. |
| `4-new_dog.c` | Function that creates a new dog. |
| `5-free_dog.c` | Function that frees dogs. |
