Singly Linked Lists in C
Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing and understanding singly linked lists in the C programming language. Linked lists are fundamental data structures in computer science, used for efficient data management and manipulation.

Objectives
Comprehend the differences and use-cases of linked lists versus arrays.
Develop skills to build and manipulate singly linked lists in C.
Requirements
Compiler: gcc on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
Coding Style: Betty coding and documentation style.
Restrictions:
No global variables.
Maximum of 5 functions per file.
Allowed functions: malloc, free, exit, and _putchar.
Files:
Source files: .c
Header files: .h (specifically lists.h)
Files in this Repository
0-main.c: Test file for the primary functionalities.
0-print_list.c: Function to print all elements of a list.
lists.h: Header file containing the structure definition and prototypes.
_putchar.c: Custom putchar function for output.
